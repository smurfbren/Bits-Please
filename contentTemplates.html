      <h1>Mirrors Edge</h1>
      
      <p>An unorthodox action game developed by studio EA DICE. The game combines the dynamic of typical first-person perspective shooters with platform game elements. The story of the game takes place in the future, in a large metropolis where every citizen is being watched “for his own good” by a totalitarian government. Among the people who don’t want to be controlled there are the so-called “runners” who mastered the art of parkour that allows them to quickly and effectively move through the concrete jungle. The player assumes the role of a female courier named Faith who is trying to protect the good name of her sister framed into murder. The gameplay consists of series of missions during which Faith uses her skills to move through the roofs and buildings while avoiding guards. In case of confrontation one can eliminate the opponent with fists or by using gunfire taken from the guard.</p>

      <h1>Star Wars Battlefront</h1>
      
      <p>  The third installment in the Star Wars-themed first person shooter series, which comes back after 10-year hiatus and with audiovisuals befitting the eight generation of consoles. After Lucas Arts Studio, who developed the first two parts, was closed, the works on the sequel were handed over to EA DICE. The game once more takes you into the age-old war for the galaxy and lets you choose one of two sides of the conflict. In the course of the game you get to visit dozens of famous locations known from George Lucas’ film saga and use all kinds of iconic weapons and vehicles. Apart from the expansive story mode the game offers a variety of multiplayer modes, in which you can cooperate and compete with players from all around the world. The visuals are powered by the advanced version of the Frostbite Engine, known from games like Need for Speed: Rivals and the Battlefield franchise. </p>

      <p> Star Wars: Battlefront is another work by famous DICE (Digital Illusions CE) Studio, a developer who strongly marked their presence among fans of electronic entertainment with the Battlefield franchise - a series of online FPP shooters. Obviously, the team’s portfolio includes several other projects, including action game Mirror’s Edge, Pinball Fantasies, or the RalliSport Challenge racing game. Battlefront is the next installment in a series of multiplayer online shooters set in the Star Wars universe, whose latest part, Star Wars: Battlefront II, appeared in 2005. The title debuted on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 17th November 2015.

PC version is a little different that the console editions. Some obvious disparities can be spotted in the visuals, which look better on a powerful computer than on PlayStation 4 or Xbox One. On the other hand, split-screen mode, offered in console versions, is unavailable to the PC user. Other elements of the game are identical on all platforms. Regardless of the game version, players have access to the same modes, weapons, vehicles, and so on.</p>

      <h1>For Honour</h1>
      
      <p> A third-person action game in a quasi-historical setting, with a focus on online competition. The production was developed by the experienced studio Ubisoft Montreal, whose portfolio includes several cult series, including Far Cry and Assassin's Creed. In the game, three factions are pitted against each other: The Chosen, The Legions, and The Warborn, modeled after the Japanese samurai, European knights, and Scandinavian Vikings respectively. During the game, each party is represented by dozens of warriors, but only four of them are controlled by players and equipped with unique abilities that can turn the tide of the battle. The game puts a great emphasis on a realistic reproduction of individual warriors’ fighting styles, and skirmishes are mostly based on the ability to use melee weapons, proper tactics, and special abilities of heroes. The online mode is complemented by a story mini-campaign that serves as an introduction to the gameplay. </p>

      <p>  

For Honor is a brutal, TPP action game in a quasi-historical reality, focused around multiplayer skirmishes. The PC / Windows version is the creation of the renowned Ubisoft Montreal studio.

The storyline of For Honor takes place in a pseudo-medieval world, where three faction are constantly at war with one another. The Chosen are the equivalent of Japanese samurai, The Legions were created to resemble the European knights, and The Warborn are a very similar band to the Scandinavian Vikings.

On the PC / Windows each of the sides of the conflict is represented by dozens of warriors; however, only four of them per faction are controlled by players. The characters they fight with are extremely skillful fighters with special abilities and they stand out significantly from the ordinary soldiers controlled by the AI; the player-controlled heroes are the ones who determine the outcome of the battle, showing up in key places of the skirmish and tipping the scales in the favor of their faction, unless they are confronted by a player (or multiple players) from the other faction, which is why swordplay is a fundamental part of the game.

Despite a light-handed approach towards being historically correct, when it comes to the choice of factions, the devs have put a lot of effort towards making the fighting styles of knights, samurai and Vikings as realistic as possible. They have also designed a game mechanic called Art of Battle, which makes the side which you hold your weapon on extremely important, as e.g. you will not block a strike from your left side if you previously choose to parry to your right side. The special attacks are also worth mentioning, for spectacularly dispatching an enemy player we can call in e.g. a catapult barrage or temporarily increase the fighting ability of nearby soldiers.

For Honor for PC / Windows also has a single player campaign, in which we are introduced to the world of the production. The game distinguishes itself from other online titles by having advanced graphics and a unique theme.

      <h1>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h1>
      
      <p> A heroic action RPG and the fifth main installment in the popular The Elder Scrolls franchise. Bethesda Softworks once again takes the players to the fantasy continent of Tamriel. The plot of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is set 200 years after the events depicted in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. The main character is the last of the Dragonborn (Dovahkiin), a human (or a member of one of the several other available races) able to wield the powerful magic of dragons. With the arrival of the last Dragonborn, an old prophecy heralding the return of Alduin - the dragon god of destruction - is set into motion. The game combines elements of dynamic action with Bethesda-style cRPG, featuring a complex system of character development and a vast, open world. High quality visuals in the game are generated by the Creation Engine, Bethesda's original graphic engine.  </p>
      
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cVrMhe3cXJg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      
      <p>The game starts with creating your avatar. You can choose from ten different races, however, there is no class distinction. Along with the progress in the game, your character becomes more and more powerful. Once you advance to a new level, you can increase one of the three basic statistics: magic, endurance, or health. The authors of the game completely rebuilt the skills system - these have been divided into distinct groups, such as one-handed or two-handed weapons. Each of these categories holds specific abilities and attacks. Changes were also made to magic - spells from Mysticism school were moved to other groups.

There is a new combat system in Skyrim, which is more dynamic and at the same time requires tactical thinking. You can now assign a weapon, shield, or spell to each of the hero’s hands. In this way, you create many combinations, for example, an offensive spell in one hand and a sword in the other. The very clashes do not boil down to mindless mashing the keys, but it is necessary to properly move your hero, avoiding or blocking strikes and knocking opponents down. The hero can easily lose balance and get exposed to attacks from enemies, who are now much more vital and dangerous. Your character is also able to perform spectacular finishing blows.</p>

<p>Another installment of The Elder Scrolls series again tries to recreate the impression of exploring a breathing world, populated by living inhabitants. Player’s decisions have now more serious consequences connected with more interesting behavior of other characters. When, for example, you drop a dagger in the center of the city, someone may bring it back to you, or quite on the contrary – steal it. Changes were also made to dialogues, which became much more natural. When you get bored with saving the world, you can relax by engaging in every-day activities. In The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim you can gather crops, forge weapons, cook, extract raw materials in mines, and even create an armor.

The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim offers a chance to explore a huge virtual world, where you can find, among others, five major cities and hundreds of dungeons. In order to make it easier to move across such a large area the authors introduced an option of fast travel between locations. Again, enemy level scaling system was used, but this time the developers made sure that it would not be so intrusive as in Oblivion. The improved mechanics assigns you missions based on your past achievements and strengths of your character. For example, when a woman asks you to find her kidnapped daughter, the system analyzes which dungeons you have already visited and then puts the girl somewhere you have not yet been, while adding there opponents that may pose a challenge for your hero.</p>

      <h1>Rocket League</h1>
      
      <p>A futuristic sports game created by Psyonix Studios. This is a sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars released in 2008 on PS3. The game features an extraordinary version of soccer, in which players drive uniquely customized rocket-powered cars, trying to get the ball into the opponent’s goal. Cars possess an array of special powers, which can be modified as you progress with over a hundred different gadgets. Matches are played on special cage-shaped arenas with power-ups scattered across them. The game lets you play through a full league season against AI, the pinnacle however, is the multiplayer, both online and local. As compared with the previous game, this one has noticeably better graphics and improved physics engine.

      <p>  The foundation of the game is very simple and similar to the rules of classic football. There are two teams (each can consist of from 1 to 4 players), two gates and one ball. The objective of the game is to put the ball in the gate of the opponent. However, it’s not humans that participate in the matches, but specially upgraded vehicles with rocket drive. The gameplay is more attractive thanks to the possibility to use booster which allows traveling through the arena faster or hitting the ball with greater strength. During the match one can also outmaneuver the opponent with various acrobatic tricks and even try to temporarily eliminate him from the game by hitting him with great speed.</p>

      <h1>Zelda Breath Of The Wild</h1>
      
      <p>Another installment in the popular action-adventure game series by Nintendo, and also the first game in the series for WiiU. In The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, you play once again as the main character of the franchise, Link, who gets involved in yet another exciting and dangerous adventure as he tries to learn what led to the downfall of the land of Hyrule. The gameplay is a combination of several genres: adventure, action RPG, and even survival. During the game, you explore the open world, solve puzzles and fight enemies; the combat is arcade-like and requires you to use varied tactics. You also have to gather resources in order to prepare food and drink, which affect your abilities, just like pieces of equipment.

      <p> The gameplay is a combination of several genres: adventure, action RPG, survival, and more. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild features a fully open world, waiting to be explored. The developers have allowed a range of options thanks to which you can reach every nook and cranny of the amazing and dangerous country. With enough determination and proper equipment, you can climb a high mountain, from where you can reach another location. It is not, however, aseasy in practice, and you need to prepare before every journey.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for Switch has much in common with survival games; during exploration, Link gathers resources, which he can then use to prepare food and drink by the fire. Those items can greatly affect your abilities, e.g. your speed or sneak skill. You should also take care of acquiring the right equipment, as, for example, it's not a good idea to go hiking into the mountains without any warm clothes.

Link has not only to face the world, but also with many puzzles and dangerous creatures roaming around Hyrule. However, there is more to the combat system than just mindlessly swinging your sword; you have to wisely choose your strategy during every battle, use surprise attacks or utilize elements of the environment (you can e.g. throw a huge stone from a nearby hill straight at the enemies lurking nearby). </p>

      <h1>Dark Souls 3</h1>
      
      <p>Another installment in the series of dark action RPGs, initiated and developed by Japanese studio From Software. The title is set in the same fantasy universe, in terms of content however, it offers a completely new story in which we visit 12 previously inaccessible locations. At the same time, the game features a more extensive plot, and the gameplay itself is accompanied by over an hour of cutscenes. The production includes as many as 12 character classes, 45 new enemies, 15 challenging bosses, 100 weapons, 40 pieces of armor and nearly 200 other items. One of the most important new features is the possibility of sacrificing the bodies of defeated enemies, which allows us to summon certain characters or haunt another player’s game. New sword fighting techniques were also introduced, and we learn them gradually as we progress in the game. Both the atmosphere characteristic of the series, and the high level of difficulty have been preserved in the sequel.

      <p>Dark Souls III follows the usual setup. Once again, the players are invited into a dark fantasy world, where dangers loom behind every corner. In terms of gameplay the game takes after its predecessors and features a challenging action-RPG adventure, prompting you to explore different locations and learn its story piece by piece. Except the story is never placed before you on a silver platter – in order to get to know the setting you’ll have to read item descriptions, talk to the characters, or even study texts written by fans. The game includes roughly an hour’s worth of cut-scenes, which is a lot for this series.

You begin with the creation of your hero. The developers have prepared 12 default character classes, which are basically all the same because, in the course of a plathrough, you can develop your character any way you want. After your character is ready, you can proceed to the game’s main course, which includes mostly exploration (in contrast to the second Dark Souls, this time the way the locations are interconnected bears some resemblance to the first installment) and combat that requires patience and a cool head. There are 45 new kinds of enemies, and each of them can pose a challenge. From time to time you’ll face one of the bosses, which are a dozen or so in total. The combat system is familiar to anybody who’s played any of the previous chapters, albeit with some new additions, including the “ready” stance, which can be used to deliver exceptionally powerful strikes.

In a true RPG manner, in time, you will gain new gear, which can then be improved to enhance its offensive and defensive capabilities. Of course, you will also find lots of items (over 200 different types) with unique properties (healing potions, antidotes, weapon enchantments, and many more.). </p>
